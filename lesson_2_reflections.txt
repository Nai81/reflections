	When you initialize a repository, git creates a hidden file where it
will store the meta-data for all the commits you create in the future. You
need to do this so that git has somewhere to store your commits.

	The staging area in git is different from both the repository and the
working directory in that it provides a transitional state between the files
you are working on and the previous status of your project that is being
tracked in the repository. This allows you to control how you would like your
changes to be tracked (say for example you edited multiple files with seperate
logical changes, but forgot to commit in between.)
